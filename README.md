# Luxury Boutique Layout Design Optimization

## Project Overview
This project aims to optimize product placement in a newly opened luxury boutique using decision analytics. The primary goals are to attract new customers, maximize store revenue, and enhance the shopping experiences of VIP clients. By applying advanced analytics to a traditional retail setting, the project seeks to revolutionize product presentation in boutique spaces.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains Fiscal Year 2019 sales data for a leading global luxury brand, including customer behavior and product popularity. The focus is on the top 5,845 SKUs, selected based on product category, launch season, and targeted gender demographics. Key metrics include:
- **New Customers**: Number of new customers purchasing the product for the first time.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated by the product.
- **VIP Customers**: Number of VIP customers (those with purchases over $3000 in the past year) purchasing the product.

## Objectives
The project's objectives are to:
1. **Increase New Customer Acquisitions**: Attract new clients through strategic product placements.
2. **Boost Annual Revenue**: Optimize product arrangements to maximize overall store revenue.
3. **Enhance VIP Purchases**: Increase the purchase frequency of VIP customers.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- **Encoding Categorical Attributes**: Transformed categorical variables such as gender, birth season, and product category into binary dummy variables.

### Optimization Model
- **Decision Variables**: Binary matrix indicating the placement of products at various store locations.
- **Objective Function**: Multi-faceted function integrating new customer attraction, revenue generation, and VIP influence.

### Constraints
- **One SKU Per Shelf**: Ensuring each shelf features only one product.
- **Unique SKU Appearance**: Each SKU appears only once in the store.
- **Showcase Window**: Displaying new seasonal products with specific rules for shoes and bags.
- **Category Representation**: Organized product displays by preassigned categories and genders.
- **Accessories Near Cash Register**: Strategically placing small accessories to boost impulse purchases.
- **Proportion of Latest Models**: Maintaining at least 70% of products from the latest season.
- **Female Product Proportion**: Ensuring at least 50% of products are targeted at women.

## Results
The base model prioritizing new customers over VIP purchases and revenue achieved:
- **Revenue**: $770,999.51
- **New Customers**: 478
- **VIP Purchases**: 27

### Extension
An advanced model incorporating discount strategies showed an increase in new customer acquisitions but a slight decrease in total revenue:
- **Revenue**: $743,993.04
- **New Customers**: 511
- **VIP Purchases**: 27

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates that strategic product placement and discount initiatives can significantly impact customer acquisition and revenue. The optimization model balances luxury positioning with dynamic pricing strategies, providing a robust tool for enhancing boutique store performance.
